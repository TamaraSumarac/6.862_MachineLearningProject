### General information

The main code of this folder for linear regression modeling is LinearRegression.ipynb. 
Files ending in .py contain helper functions I use in my main codes. 
Codes starting with word Development are the ones I was using when I was developing main codes, and they contain a lot of my skratch work. 
DataExploration code is code that I used to play with this data to understand it better.
