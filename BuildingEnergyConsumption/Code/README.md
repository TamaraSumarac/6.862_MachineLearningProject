## General information

The **main codes** of this folder is **RegressionModels.ipynb** that I used to understand different regression modeling and **LSTMmodels.ipynb** that I used to make predictions using several LSTM based models. 
* Files ending in .py contain helper functions I use in my main codes. 
* Codes in Development folder are the ones I was using when I was developing main codes, and they contain a lot of my skratch work.
